# Home_Sales

# Author: Paul Keller

The purpose of this activity was to view home sale data using SparkSQL. Previous SQL skills such as creating queries are used within temporary views of data sets. The speeds of these retrieved queries are also tested against the run time of a cached temporary table. After these queries are conducted, the temporary views are closed and the Spark session is stopped.
